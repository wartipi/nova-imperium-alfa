# Overview

This is Nova Imperium, a strategic role-playing game built with React, TypeScript, and Express. Initially developed as a Civilization-style foundation, the game is evolving toward a dynamic world where player choices, alliances, and betrayals shape destiny. The application features a hexagonal tile-based map, faction-based gameplay, reputation systems, and immersive world-building mechanics. The game includes territory management, character progression, faction creation, and a complex honor/dishonor system overseen by the Guilde de Pandem.

## Nova Imperium Vision
- Dynamic reputation system affecting available actions and alliances
- Player-created factions that emerge from actions, not preset kingdoms
- The Guilde de Pandem as the omnipresent overseeing faction
- Real consequences for choices, promises, and betrayals

- Final resource system now contains:
  - 3 basic resources: food, action_points, gold
  - 4 strategic resources: iron, stone, wood, precious_metals
  - 3 magical resources: mana, crystals, ancient_knowledge
- Updated all interfaces, terrain yields, and UI components to reflect streamlined system

### Action Points Mechanic Implementation (January 17, 2025)
- Implemented comprehensive Action Points system based on Nova Imperium prototype
- Player store enhanced with Action Points tracking (current/max, spending, adding, limits)
- Action Points displayed in player info panel (25/100 starting values)
- Created ActionPointsCosts system defining costs for all game actions:
  - Building construction costs (4-25 PA depending on building type)
  - Unit movement costs (1-4 PA per tile, with 5x maximum)
  - Special actions: exploration (5 PA), diplomacy (3 PA), research (8 PA)
- Created ActionPointsGeneration system for building-based AP generation:
  - Buildings generate 1-8 PA per turn based on type and strategic value
  - Special buildings increase maximum AP capacity (8-20 bonus)
  - Magical/ancient buildings provide highest generation rates
- ActionPointsPanel interface showing costs, generation, and management options
- System bridges live GN events with online platform actions
- Integrated with existing game mechanics for construction and movement

### Game Guide Enhancement (January 17, 2025)
- Updated GameGuidePanel with Nova Imperium-specific content

- Removed Guild of Pandem references for now
- Enhanced tips and keyboard shortcuts for current game systems
- Guide accessible through HUD interface with tabbed navigation

### HUD Close Button System (January 17, 2025)
- Implemented comprehensive close button system for better UX
- HUD panel windows (treasury, construction, recruitment, etc.) have close buttons
- TileInfoPanel has close button for easy dismissal
- Modal windows (character selector, competence tree) have close buttons  
- Only permanent HUD elements (player info, minimap, controls) lack close buttons
- Consistent user experience with appropriate close controls throughout interface

### Construction & Recruitment Panel Expansion (January 17, 2025)
- Expanded ConstructionPanel with all 22 available building types organized by category
- Building categories: Transport, Agriculture, D√©fense, Culture, Magie, Ancien
- Each building has detailed description, cost, and thematic icon
- Expanded RecruitmentPanel with 16 unit types across 6 categories
- Unit categories: Infanterie, Distance, Si√®ge, Cavalerie, Marine, Sp√©cial
- Both panels now show comprehensive options with category organization for better navigation

### UI Layout Updates (January 17, 2025)
- Moved minimap to lower right corner as requested for better HUD organization
- Control buttons (sound toggle) now positioned in lower left corner
- Reputation system integrated into player info box with clickable details modal
- Centered left menu panel vertically on screen for better visual balance

### Nova Imperium Game Mechanics Integration (January 17, 2025)
- Implemented comprehensive Nova Imperium game mechanics based on user specifications
- Honor and dishonor system with clear consequences for player choices
- Faction creation requires 2 GN events participation OR valid season card
- Faction system includes charter, emblem, structure, and territory management
- Distinction between public alliances (visible to all) and secret alliances (GN-based)
- Betrayal consequences: -150 honor for public alliances, -75 for secret alliances
- GN actions directly influence online reputation and available content
- Reputation-based content access system guides players toward different gameplay paths
- Enhanced FactionPanel with creation, alliance management, and reputation tracking

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the main application
- **Vite** for development and build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering capabilities (with drei and postprocessing)
- **Canvas-based game engine** for hex map rendering and game visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **RESTful API** structure with middleware for logging and error handling
- **In-memory storage** for game state (with interface for future database integration)
- **Development-only Vite integration** for hot reloading

### Database Strategy
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database
- **Schema-first approach** with Zod validation
- **Migration system** ready for deployment
- Currently using in-memory storage for development

## Key Components

### Game Engine
- **GameEngine class** handles canvas rendering, camera controls, and hex coordinate conversion
- **MapGenerator** creates procedural hex-based maps with realistic terrain distribution
- **Combat system** with unit-to-unit fighting and experience
- **AI system** for computer-controlled civilizations

### State Management
- **useGameState** - manages game phases, turns, and core game loop
- **useMap** - handles hex map data and selection
- **useCivilizations** - manages multiple civilizations, units, cities, and diplomacy
- **useAudio** - controls background music and sound effects

### UI Components
- **GameCanvas** - main game viewport with click handling
- **GameUI** - overlay interface with panels and controls
- **Specialized panels** for cities, units, technology, and diplomacy
- **Responsive design** with mobile support

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: Map generation ‚Üí Civilization setup ‚Üí Game state initialization
2. **Turn Processing**: Player actions ‚Üí AI turns ‚Üí Resource calculation ‚Üí Victory checks
3. **User Interaction**: Canvas clicks ‚Üí State updates ‚Üí UI re-renders ‚Üí Server sync
4. **Real-time Updates**: State changes ‚Üí Canvas re-rendering ‚Üí UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless** - PostgreSQL database connection
- **@radix-ui/** - Comprehensive UI component library
- **@react-three/** - 3D rendering ecosystem
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Server state management
- **drizzle-orm** - Type-safe database ORM
- **zod** - Schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Client build** - Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Server build** - esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database migrations** - Drizzle pushes schema changes

### Environment Setup
- **DATABASE_URL** required for PostgreSQL connection
- **Development mode** includes Vite middleware for hot reloading
- **Production mode** serves static files from dist directory

### Scaling Considerations
- **Stateless server design** allows for horizontal scaling
- **Database-backed persistence** replaces in-memory storage
- **Session management** for multiplayer support
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time multiplayer gameplay

The application is structured as a full-stack TypeScript application with clear separation between game logic, state management, and presentation layers. The modular architecture supports future enhancements like multiplayer functionality, advanced AI, and additional game features.
