# Overview

This is a Civilization-style strategy game built with React, TypeScript, and Express. The application features a hexagonal tile-based map, turn-based gameplay, multiple civilizations, and classic 4X game mechanics (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate). The game includes city management, unit control, technology research, and basic diplomacy systems.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the main application
- **Vite** for development and build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering capabilities (with drei and postprocessing)
- **Canvas-based game engine** for hex map rendering and game visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **RESTful API** structure with middleware for logging and error handling
- **In-memory storage** for game state (with interface for future database integration)
- **Development-only Vite integration** for hot reloading

### Database Strategy
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database
- **Schema-first approach** with Zod validation
- **Migration system** ready for deployment
- Currently using in-memory storage for development

## Key Components

### Game Engine
- **GameEngine class** handles canvas rendering, camera controls, and hex coordinate conversion
- **MapGenerator** creates procedural hex-based maps with realistic terrain distribution
- **Combat system** with unit-to-unit fighting and experience
- **AI system** for computer-controlled civilizations

### State Management
- **useGameState** - manages game phases, turns, and core game loop
- **useMap** - handles hex map data and selection
- **useCivilizations** - manages multiple civilizations, units, cities, and diplomacy
- **useAudio** - controls background music and sound effects

### UI Components
- **GameCanvas** - main game viewport with click handling
- **GameUI** - overlay interface with panels and controls
- **Specialized panels** for cities, units, technology, and diplomacy
- **Responsive design** with mobile support

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: Map generation â†’ Civilization setup â†’ Game state initialization
2. **Turn Processing**: Player actions â†’ AI turns â†’ Resource calculation â†’ Victory checks
3. **User Interaction**: Canvas clicks â†’ State updates â†’ UI re-renders â†’ Server sync
4. **Real-time Updates**: State changes â†’ Canvas re-rendering â†’ UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless** - PostgreSQL database connection
- **@radix-ui/** - Comprehensive UI component library
- **@react-three/** - 3D rendering ecosystem
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Server state management
- **drizzle-orm** - Type-safe database ORM
- **zod** - Schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Client build** - Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Server build** - esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database migrations** - Drizzle pushes schema changes

### Environment Setup
- **DATABASE_URL** required for PostgreSQL connection
- **Development mode** includes Vite middleware for hot reloading
- **Production mode** serves static files from dist directory

### Scaling Considerations
- **Stateless server design** allows for horizontal scaling
- **Database-backed persistence** replaces in-memory storage
- **Session management** for multiplayer support
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time multiplayer gameplay

The application is structured as a full-stack TypeScript application with clear separation between game logic, state management, and presentation layers. The modular architecture supports future enhancements like multiplayer functionality, advanced AI, and additional game features.
