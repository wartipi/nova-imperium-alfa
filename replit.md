# Overview

This is Nova Imperium, a strategic role-playing game built with React, TypeScript, and Express. Initially developed as a Civilization-style foundation, the game is evolving toward a dynamic world where player choices, alliances, and betrayals shape destiny. The application features a hexagonal tile-based map, faction-based gameplay, reputation systems, and immersive world-building mechanics. The game includes territory management, character progression, faction creation, and a complex honor/dishonor system overseen by the Guilde de Pandem.

## Nova Imperium Vision
- Dynamic reputation system affecting available actions and alliances
- Player-created factions that emerge from actions, not preset kingdoms
- The Guilde de Pandem as the omnipresent overseeing faction
- Real consequences for choices, promises, and betrayals
